##  if error during sudo apt install ./homeassistant-supervised.deb: E: Repository 'http://ppa.linuxfactory.or.kr bookworm InRelease' changed its 'Origin' value from 'Dongjin Kim <tobetter@gmail.com>' to 'LinuxFactory'

##  Check if NetworkManager active:
  root@server:/home/odroid# nmcli general status
  should be:
STATE      CONNECTIVITY  WIFI-HW  WIFI     WWAN-HW  WWAN    
connected  full          missing  enabled  missing  enabled 

1. List Active Network Services
Run the following command to see active network-related services:
sudo systemctl list-units | grep -i network

1. Disable systemd-networkd

sudo systemctl disable systemd-networkd.service
sudo systemctl stop systemd-networkd.service

Disable the associated socket as well:

sudo systemctl disable systemd-networkd.socket
sudo systemctl stop systemd-networkd.socket

2. Mask the Service
Masking ensures that systemd-networkd cannot be started by any process:

sudo systemctl mask systemd-networkd.service
sudo systemctl mask systemd-networkd.socket

3. Confirm that NetworkManager is enabled:

sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager

4. Verify the Status
Check if it's disabled and stopped:

sudo systemctl status systemd-networkd.service
It should show as inactive or disabled.

5. Reboot

apparmor filesystem is not mounted.

1. Edit /etc/default/flash-kernel. Add security=apparmor to the line starts with LINUX_KERNEL_CMDLINE
2. The change will be affected after rebooting, but you must update /boot/bot.scr to have security=apparmor by running sudo update-bootscript.
